/**
 * Actions menu (B3, B34) for the detail header: a "⋯" button opening a dropdown
 * of kind-appropriate mutations.
 *
 * Since B39 this file is only the trigger and its placement — the items,
 * confirmations, and forms live in {@link ActionList}, shared with the table's
 * row context menu. That sharing is the point: two copies of "what can be done
 * to this kind" would eventually disagree, and the first divergence would be a
 * menu offering Delete on something the other refuses.
 *
 * The panel always acts on exactly one row: the one it is showing. Bulk is a
 * table concept, and a panel acting on rows it isn't displaying would be lying
 * about its own header.
